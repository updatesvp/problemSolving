Problem-1-> May 30th 2015:
-------------------------
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters  What if you 
can not use additional data structures? (1.1)


Pranesh Vyas:
Does the last statement mean we should not use another data structure like hash tables or what does that exactly mean?
Please revert.


Problem-2-> May 31st 2015:
-------------------------

Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and 
column is set to 0 (1.7)

Problem-3-> June 1st 2015:
-------------------------

Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string 
without using any additional buffer  NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine    
An extra copy of the array is not 
FOLLOW UP
Write the test cases for this method (1.3)

Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not (1.4)

Problem-5-> June2nd 2015:
------------------------

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’ (1.5)
